# kantoku (監督)

`kantoku` is a small tool to manage just about everything at the student café [ascii](https://ascii-dresden.de).

**Please note:** Currently, this is as WIP as a project can be. There is literally nothing here except for ambitious ideas and some skeleton code.

## Planned Features (or Roadmap)

- [ ] provide a small library that gives abstractions and types for the basic management of a shift:
  - [ ] a shiftplan
  - [ ] a list of members
  - [ ] a list of accumulated debts
  - [ ] facilities to track absentees
- [ ] a small web server to give a web interface for interacting with the shift plan and the debt list
- [ ] a telegram bot for announcing empty shifts
